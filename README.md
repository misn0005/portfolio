# portfolio

I created this web portfolio using modern responsive design and web development techniques. utilizing standard accessibility and optimization practices. Its purpose is to show off not only coding proficiency, but my design and User experience proficiency as well.
 
as my site includes a fair amount of images, one of the more difficult things to overcome while creating this portfolio site include ensuring that all images were responsive to both desktop and mobile views, allowing everything to be scaled and optimized depending on screen size, as well as making sure each had alternative text for accessibility
